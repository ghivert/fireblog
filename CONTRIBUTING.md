# Contributing to Personal Blog

First, thanks for your interest!

Here are the guidelines for contributing:

- Respect the elm spacing. I know I'm using 2 spaces indent (which does not respect elm-format), but it's my choice. I'm not forcing you to daily code with 2 spaces, don't force me to daily code with elm-format. If you think this point is too constraining, please, just give up. I won't change my mind, so don't try to make me change. 😁
- One JS file should contain one export in general. Exceptions exists, like index.js, but try to stick with one export by file, like for Posts.
- You want to contribute, but don't know how? Write some docs! It's really helpful, and we always miss docs!
