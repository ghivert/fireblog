# Personal Blog

This repo aims to provide a fully functional blog working with Firebase, able to deploy it in a second (configuration excluded).

It tries to follow the good rules, i.e. accessibility, rich web content, or Single-Page Application.

# I like this project, can I use it and contribute?

Of course! I would be glad that you'll use it! If you do any modifications, PR me to let everyone enjoy it! I'm using it for my own blog, use it if you like it! üòÅ
